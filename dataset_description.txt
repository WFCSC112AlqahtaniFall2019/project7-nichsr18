My dataset is the top 100 most listened to songs on Spotify in 2017. This includes the name of the song, the artist, danceability, and energy. Danceability is calculated with 0 being the least danceable and 1 being the most danceable based on how good of a song it is to dance to. Energy is calculated with 0 being the least energetic and 1 being the most energetic based on the percieved intensity of the song. I chose this dataset because I listen to Spotify a lot and still listen to a lot of these songs from 2017. I chose to sort by danceability because I used to dance and know how certain aspects of songs make them easier or harder to make choreography for.
